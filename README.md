Final presentation: [SIADS523 - Final Presentation.pdf]()

## Course Overview

This repository contains the deliverables for the SIADS 523: Communicating Data Science Results course project. The course focused on developing effective communication skills for data scientists, emphasizing the importance of tailoring content for different audiences and utilizing various communication formats.

## Project Scenario: Chicken Kitchen Expansion

The project centered around a data-driven decision-making scenario for Chicken Kitchen, a premium fast-casual restaurant chain. As a data scientist, I was tasked with analyzing potential expansion locations for the franchise.

### Chicken Kitchen Profile

- Positioned as "premium fast casual with great service"
- Appealed to consumers willing to pay slightly more than budget fast food prices
- Offered food with "clean" ingredients (e.g., no preservatives)
- Known for friendly service and delicious taste
- Successful locations typically in communities that were:
  - More conservative
  - Higher income
  - Younger demographics
  - More recently developed areas
- More profitable near upscale fast food restaurants (e.g., Chipotle, CoreLife, Qdoba) than budget options (e.g., McDonald's, Taco Bell)

### Ideal Location Characteristics

Chicken Kitchen performed well in areas with:
- Recent development
- Highway proximity
- Household income above the national median
- Car-centric culture (as opposed to reliance on public transportation)
- Potential for continued population growth and development
- Strong dining-out culture
- More conservative-leaning demographics

## Project Task

The franchise department of Chicken Kitchen requested assistance in identifying a new location for expansion. The task involved:

1. Researching and comparing two counties (one from Michigan and one from another state)
2. Determining which county was more advantageous for expansion
3. Identifying specific action steps for the organization within the preferred county
4. Explaining why the other county was rejected

## Methodology

### Data Sources

The analysis incorporated data from various sources, including:

1. American Community Survey (ACS) data via CensusReporter.org
2. United States Census data via Gale Business DemographicsNow
3. Consumer behavior and profile data from Gale Business DemographicsNow
4. Web data from Google Maps, Wikipedia, and Yelp

### Key Success Criteria

The analysis focused on the following key success criteria:

1. Total Population
2. Stable or increasing population of young people
3. Income Growth
4. Infrastructure
5. Peer Competitors

## Analysis and Results

The project compared two counties: Oakland County, MI and Bergen County, NJ.

### Key Findings

1. **Total Population (2020)**
   - Oakland County, MI: 1,257,982
   - Bergen County, NJ: 941,439

2. **Young Population (age 20 to 44)**
   - Oakland County maintained a stable young population at approximately 31.5%

3. **Income Growth**
   - Oakland County showed an estimated 8% growth in the 100k+ income group from 2020 to 2025

4. **Infrastructure**
   - Oakland County has good infrastructure with 3 interstate highways (I-96, I-275, I-75)

5. **Peer Competitors**
   - The presence of peer competitors in Oakland County was noted, indicating a strong market for premium fast-casual dining

### Recommendation

Based on the analysis, Oakland County, MI was recommended for Chicken Kitchen's expansion. Reasons for not choosing Bergen County, NJ included:
- Smaller total population
- Slightly lower percentage of young population
- Lower projected income growth in the 100k+ bracket

## Recommended Next Steps

1. Select Oakland County for expansion and continue monitoring Bergen County
2. Focus on Novi City within Oakland County
3. Initiate real-estate research in the target area
4. Adjust marketing campaigns to align with the local demographic profile

## Deliverables

The project resulted in three main deliverables:

1. **Executive Summary**: A concise overview of findings and recommendations for the CEO and executive team.
2. **Technical Report**: A detailed analysis of the data, methodologies used, and justification for the recommendations.
3. **Oral Presentation**: A five-minute recorded presentation summarizing the key points of the analysis and recommendations.

These deliverables were tailored for an audience of the company CEO and their executive team, who, while data-oriented, did not have a background in data science or highly-technical analysis.

## Tools and Technologies Used

- Data Analysis: 
  - American Community Survey (ACS) via CensusReporter.org
  - United States Census data via Gale Business DemographicsNow
  - Consumer behavior and profile data from Gale Business DemographicsNow
- Visualization: 
  - Charts created using data from Gale Business DemographicsNow
  - Maps sourced from Google Maps and Wikipedia
- Additional Research:
  - Web data from Google Maps, Wikipedia, and Yelp
- Presentation: PowerPoint or similar software (based on the PDF format of the presentation)
